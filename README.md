# cljs-reloaded
A Leiningen template for kick-starting a reloaded cljs app.

# Provided functionality
* A default clojure namespace (`build/user.clj`) with a bunch of utility functions, including:
  * `(fresh-browser-repl)`: Cleans, builds, and starts a repl
  * `(browser-repl)`: Just starts a repl
  * `(fresh-node-repl)`: Cleans, builds, and starts a repl
  * `(node-repl)`: Just starts a repl
* Both ClojureScript REPLs are wrapped with Piggieback, so you should be able to use them seamlessly with your favorite IDE/Editor
* A `browser.user` ClojureScript namespace with all of your reloaded functions plus `(run-tests)`
* A `node.user` ClojureScript namespace with all of your reloaded functions plus `(run-tests)`
* A build script `bin/build-cljs`
* Test namespaces are automatically added to the REPLs, so you can run your tests.

# Example Usage
```
lein new cljs-reloaded my.group/my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project/
lein repl
```

Now in the repl:
```
user=> (fresh-browser-repl)
Navigate to  file:/private/tmp/my-awesome-project/target/public/index.html
:reloading (prod-build user)
<< started Weasel server on ws://127.0.0.1:9001 >>
<< waiting for client to connect ...  connected! >>
To quit, type: :cljs/quit
nil
cljs.user=> (refresh)
:reloading ()
:rebuilding
:requesting-reload (my.group.my-awesome-project my.group.my-awesome-project-test browser.user)
:ok
nil
cljs.user=> (in-ns 'browser.user)
nil
browser.user=> (run-tests)
