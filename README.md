# cljs-reloaded
A Leiningen template for kick-starting a reloaded cljs app.

# Goals
1. Make it easy to get a no-magic ClojureScript project with a REPL started.
2. Make it easy to use the [Reloaded Workflow](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded) in ClojureScript.

tire-iron was created to facilitate the Reloaded Workflow. However, the barrier
to getting a ClojureScript REPL up and running is still rather high. This project
is an attempt to delay the need to learn about that complexity, while simultaneously
refusing to hide complexity from you in the long run.

# Provided functionality
* A default clojure namespace (`build/user.clj`) with a bunch of utility functions, including:
  * `(fresh-browser-repl)`: Cleans, builds, and starts a repl
  * `(browser-repl)`: Just starts a repl
  * `(fresh-node-repl)`: Cleans, builds, and starts a repl
  * `(node-repl)`: Just starts a repl
* Both ClojureScript REPLs are wrapped with Piggieback, so you should be able to use them seamlessly with your favorite IDE/Editor
* A `browser.user` ClojureScript namespace with all of your reloaded functions plus `(run-tests)`
* A `node.user` ClojureScript namespace with all of your reloaded functions plus `(run-tests)`
* A build script `bin/build-cljs`
* Test namespaces are added to the REPLs by default

# Example Usage
```sh
lein new cljs-reloaded my.group/my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project/
lein repl
```

Now an example REPL session:
```clj
user=> (fresh-browser-repl)
Navigate to  file:/private/tmp/my-awesome-project/target/public/index.html
:reloading (prod-build user)
<< started Weasel server on ws://127.0.0.1:9001 >>
<< waiting for client to connect ...  connected! >>
To quit, type: :cljs/quit
nil
cljs.user=> (refresh)
:reloading ()
:rebuilding
:requesting-reload (my.group.my-awesome-project my.group.my-awesome-project-test browser.user)
:ok
nil
cljs.user=> (in-ns 'browser.user)
nil
browser.user=> (run-tests)

Testing my.group.my-awesome-project-test

FAIL in (a-test) (at file:432:14)
FIXME, I fail.
expected: (= 0 1)
  actual: (not (= 0 1))

Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions.
1 failures, 0 errors.
nil
cljs.user=> :cljs/quit
;; You may get a stacktrace here. That's weasel's way of saying "I'll miss you."

;; You can also use a node repl
user=> (fresh-node-repl)
cljs.user=> (refresh :before nil) ;; :before nil is useful for initially loading a node app
:reloading ()
:rebuilding
:requesting-reload (my.group.my-awesome-project my.group.my-awesome-project-test node.user)
:ok
nil
cljs.user=> (in-ns 'node.user)
nil
cljs.user=> (run-tests)
